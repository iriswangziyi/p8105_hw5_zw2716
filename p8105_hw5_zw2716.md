Homework 5

## Problem 1

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository.

1.  Read in the data. Describe the raw data. Create a city\_state
    variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to
    obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved
    homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without
    arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

2.  Can I do a prop test for a single city? For the city of Baltimore,
    MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of
    homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R
    object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated
    proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy
    dataframe.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

3.  Try to iterate …….. Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your
    dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and
    the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline,
    making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as
    necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and
    CIs for each city.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

4.  Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check
    out geom\_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper
    and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of
    unsolved homicides.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

A data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an
experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate
file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

1.  Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants,
    including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

<!-- end list -->

  - Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
    function will help
  - Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
    purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

<!-- end list -->

``` r
path_df = 
  
  # a dataframe containing all file names
  tibble(path = list.files("lda_data")) %>% 
  
  # Iterate over file names, read in data for each subject, save result as a new var
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)
  ) %>% 

  # Tidy the result: manipulate file names to include arm and subject ID
  unnest(data) %>%
  mutate(
    path = str_remove(path, "lda_data/"),
    path = str_remove(path, ".csv")
  ) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = case_when(
      arm == "con" ~ "control",
      arm == "exp" ~ "experimental"
    )
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  )
```

2.  Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over
    time, and comment on differences between groups.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
spaghetti_plot = path_df %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = arm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  labs(x = "Week",
       y = "Observations",
       title = "Observations of the Control and Experimental Arms Over 8 Weeks") +
  theme_minimal()

spaghetti_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_zw2716_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

**Comment on differences between groups:**  
In the above spaghetti plot, each yellow line represents the
observations for each subject from the experimental arm; and each purple
line represents the observations for each subject from the control
arm.  
According to the plot, we can see the yellow lines (experimental arm)
had much higher observation values compare to the purple lines (control
arm) starting from the second week. In addition, the observation values
of the control arm did not vary much across the 8 weeks, whereas, the
observation values of the experimental arm increased over the 8 weeks.

## Problem 3

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix σ=5 Set μ=0. Generate 5000 datasets from the model

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power. Make a plot
showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true value of μ
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Is the sample average of μ̂
across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the
true value of μ? Why or why not?
